## How to run app
if you are using gitpod it will run automatically,
however, if you are in VScode locally, you must install npm:
### `npm install`
and then run it:
### `npm start`
and the app will be available in your localhost:3000 server

if gitpod doesnt run the app automatically, try to follow the steps for local
